The coordinate conventions for our SH lighting (positive x, y, and z) are the same as Deep Portrait Relighting (DPR), and are shown below:

        ^ z  > y
        |  /
        | /
        |/            
--------------------------> x
        |
        |

The order of the SH terms is 1, Y, Z, X, YX, YZ, 3Z^2-1, XZ, X^2-Y^2
